The first version of this code was written by Chun Yu Hong in summer
2013 during his Research Experience for Undergraduates at UC Davis
under supervision by Matthias Koeppe.

It was later revised and extended by Matthias Koeppe and Yuan Zhou.

Yuan Zhou wrote the electronic compendium of extreme functions.

Masumi Sugiyama contributed the mlr_cpl3_... functions to the
compendium, and added functions that convert between group functions
and superadditive lifting functions.
